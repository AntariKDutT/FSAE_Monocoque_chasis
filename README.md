# 🏎️ Design and Analysis of FSAE Monocoque Chassis Frame – Formula Student 2023  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository showcases the **design and analysis of a monocoque chassis** developed for the **Formula Student 2023 competition**.  
The project aimed to create a **lightweight, safe, and high-performance chassis** while ensuring compliance with FSAE regulations.  

As **Vice Captain**, I led the team in **design, simulation, material benchmarking, and project coordination**, ensuring the final design met both performance and safety requirements.

## ✨ Key Responsibilities  
- **Team Leadership** – Served as Vice Captain, managing project planning, task allocation, and collaboration among sub-teams.  
- **Chassis Design** – Developed a **monocoque chassis frame** optimized for weight reduction and stiffness while meeting FSAE competition rules.  
- **Simulation & Analysis** – Conducted **torsional stiffness, frontal impact, and side impact analyses** using ANSYS to validate structural performance.  
- **Material Selection** – Benchmarked advanced composites (Hexcel AS4, Gurit SE 84LV) to achieve optimal **strength-to-weight ratio** and safety factor >1.5.  
- **Ergonomics & Safety** – Ensured cockpit design supported driver comfort, visibility, and rapid egress within competition standards.
